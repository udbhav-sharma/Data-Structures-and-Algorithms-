/*
You are given an array of N elements. Each element in the range Min of int to Max of Int. You need to find the length of longest sequence in this array such that difference of largest and smallest element of that sequence is 1. The sequence need not be sequential. 

For e.g. array[]={6,10,6,7,8,9,0} 
seq {6,10} = diff is 4 len 2 
seq { 10,7,8} diff is 3 len 3 
seq { 7,8,9} diff 2 len 3 
seq {6,6,7} diff is 1 len 3 

In this example the program should return 3 . 

Complexity N*longN
*/

Algorithm (A,N)
	Sort all the elements using MergeSort O(N logN)
	max_start=1
	max_end=1
	temp_start=1
	for i=1 to N
		if A[temp_start]-A[i] <=1
		    temp_end=i
		else
			temp_start=i+1
		if temp_end-temp_start > max_end-max_start
		    max_start=temp_start
		    max_end=temp_end
	print(A,max_start,max_end)
