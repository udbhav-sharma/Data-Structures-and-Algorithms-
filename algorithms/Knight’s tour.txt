Backtracking Algorithm for Knightâ€™s tour

If all squares are visited 
    print the solution
Else
   a) Add one of the next moves to solution vector and recursively 
   check if this move leads to a solution. (A Knight can make maximum 
   eight moves. We choose one of the 8 moves in this step).
   b) If the move chosen in the above step doesn't lead to a solution
   then remove this move from the solution vector and try other 
   alternative moves.
   c) If none of the alternatives work then return false (Returning false 
   will remove the previously added item in recursion and if false is 
   returned by the initial call of recursion then "no solution exists" )
