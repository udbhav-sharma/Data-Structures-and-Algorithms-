/*
Write a program to replace each element of an array with a number present on the right side of the element such that the number is least greater than the element. If there is no greater number replace it with -1 

e.g : 8, 58, 71, 18, 31, 32, 63, 92, 43, 3, 91, 93, 25, 80, 28 
ans : 18, 63, 80, 25, 32, 43, 80, 93, 80, 25, 93, -1, 28, -1, -1
*/

Here is an O(nlogn) [amortized] approach using a threaded BST where each node points to the next in order successor. 
1) read the array from right to left 
2) Insert each element into a threaded BST. 
3) Output the inorder successor after each insertion.
